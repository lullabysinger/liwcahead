# liwcahead
Port of Ken Benoit's [liwcalike](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda.dictionaries), based on standard liwc .dic specifications, to Python.
We aim to add extra regex functionality.


## Important Note
Citing [Christopher Brown](https://github.com/chbrown/liwc-python) 's disclaimer from `chbrown/liwc-python`:

```
This is not an official LIWC product nor is it in any way affiliated with the LIWC development team or Receptiviti.
The LIWC lexicon is proprietary, so it is not included in this repository.
The lexicon data can be acquired (purchased) from liwc.net.
Finally, please do not open an issue in this repository with the intent of subverting encryption implemented by the LIWC developers.
